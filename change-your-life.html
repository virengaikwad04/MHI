                    I have worked with Shashi for the past 3 months and he led me to believe and see for myself that LCHF diet can be miraculous. Through weekly zoom sessions, he gave me all possible guidance on what I should & should not include in my ‘low carb’ diet. We tracked & monitored my progress every week. Food recipes, ideal low carb foods, foods to completely do away with, the dumbest of doubts were addressed by Shashi. Time zone difference did not matter as I am based in Canada, as Shashi was very flexible & available when I needed his guidance. I am eternally grateful to Shashi to guide me on the LCHF diet path & I could get by HBA1C miraculously down from 9.4 to 5.7 in just 3.5 months without any medication.

                <p>
                    On 12 March 2021, I was asked to get few blood tests by my Gynecologist as we were planning to conceive. Evening hell broke loose as I saw my Mean Blood Glucose was 400+ and Hb1Ac was 13. For the first 3-5 months, I was taking close Tablets prescribed by the doctor and yes deep in my heart – I used to think about the tablets dosage I was taking at this age.
                    My husband spoke to me about a nutritionist’s twitter account, highly appreciated by the Doctors and the success stories. We wanted to give it a try. We consulted Shashi Iyengar over twitter, and he was instant in his reply. 
                    We shared our lifestyle, Food preference and doctors’ medication prescribed. He was like a teacher explaining ‘Science of Food’, debunking many misconceptions and shared a lot of articles for me to read and be educated. He was very methodical in his approach; he started off with complete blood test. Based on all the information he came up with a tailored ‘Systemic plan’. 
                    Well, the magic worked the results started appearing in days – My BG levels came down under 90. I had to go to doctors to decrease the medications in a gradual way. Under 6 months, I was off medications and Hb1Ac was at the range of 5.2 – 5.6 since then till date. 
                    And yes, I had reservations about the tasty options that is available for High Protein Diet in Vegetarians, Shashi has a solution there as well – he sent a big list of ‘How to Cook’ manual. That had wonderful recipes that helped me to satisfy my tongue and stay health!!
                    Thank you, Shashi!

                    Before meeting Shashi, I struggled with diabetes for years. Despite taking medications, my blood sugar levels remained high, and I felt tired and sluggish all the time. But Shashi gave me hope. He shared his own success story of reversing his diabetes through lifestyle changes, and offered guidance and support every step of the way. Thanks to his expert knowledge and unwavering encouragement, I was able to make meaningful changes to my diet and exercise routine. And the results speak for themselves - I have now been able to get off my diabetes medications, my blood sugar levels are stable, and I have more energy and vitality than I've had in years. I cannot thank Shashi enough for his dedication and passion for helping others achieve optimal health.
